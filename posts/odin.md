"Jack, we have done our job and done it well. This fight was passed down to us and will continue on with or without us. But we will always be better than institutions we serve. And that is what matters, when matters most. There are no hero's in our profession, but occasionaly there are good men. Men who act on what is right, not simply doing what they are told. I've not always lift my life with honor, but perhaps I have done enough to die with it. I hope the same for you." - Luka Goncharov

Oh dear Percy, who got hit with a feeling of depression, puzzled about why life just feels like a cold nail, that sweet warm blanket lays in front of you. Through hardship and pain, we learn what we truly love. The spacerocket that you dreamed of has yet to be finished, but is already showing signs of magnificence and a sprinkle with pure gold. The steps it took to just be able to send people into space.
