In all honesty, we have all been there before. A cycle of at first
enthousiasm and sharing excitement to a phase of doubt and uncertainty.
Everybody has dreams and it might seem like a perfect picture, but
slowly the realization of the work required sets in. Gradually the hype
will slow down and the effort required to keep going will increase. Most
of them will drop out when the results seem further away then they are
willing to dream.

People tend to think I'm pessimistic, but most of the time I'm trying to
figure out certain aspects and naturally pessimistic sides will come
out. In the end, for me it is about how we proceed with the feelings and
thoughts. Figuring out all the outcomes creates a framework for me to
work and to deal with the possible negatives, so my mind is dealing with
negatives before it happens. It might be a mistake, but for now I will
see it as a power I have. The power of foresight, you might say.

With that being said. It is time to get the grind going and to keep the
heart and mind flowing. I have realized I am a purist, but I was raised
to be materialistic and to be greedy for money. Although it does not
match well with who I am, I will become greedy for money. I will earn
the money required to make my short-term goals possible, because I want
to start living a life that is pure, one that is solely dedicated to whatever I love.
