‚ÄúWealth consists not in having great possessions, but in having few wants.‚Äù

There are a few things I want nowadays. Does it actually mean that I am rich?

The times do seem a bit better. You see, I started coding, started playing a
new sport and I am almost near my goal that I wished to accomplish for a few studious
years now. Things do seem to get better. It is hard at times, but we are not able to impact
all aspects of life, are we? The path forward seems to be the only logical road to me. This
can't be the end. In the moments wherein I not tried to work the hardest, I
would directly see everything in my life start collapsing.

To work hard did not only mean to push to the limit at work, but it meant to do my best
to not let the mind cave in at times. Sometimes mental problems feel like the most
difficult thing to overcome. They drain all your dopamine and it shuts you away from
things that you enjoyed in life. But I realized by trying to fake a smile every day and
been given back smiles one day, gave me rebellious sparks of light in the harder moments.
It is a cheatcode to survive life it seems.

Hopefully people will realize that happiness and kindness are the only truth in this strange life.
The question you should ask yourself is: what will appear in front of you when you are about
to release your final breath? Only love seems to be the answer/the key/the way in these moments.
By realizing so and trying to learn how to behave so, the path to happiness seems clear.

This life might treat you with hard waters at times, but through all of that the heart
will still keep pounding, the limbs will even so move and the gears in the mind will yet grind. Let's fight in
these hard times in life, so at the end we can be proud of our attempts. Proud of showing the
courage to smile through hardship and maybe one day even shedding a light in one other.

Helping others, means to be helped. Having that simple goal seems to lead to the ultimate wealth,
a last rush of pure dopamine when the lights dim down.
