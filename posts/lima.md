Out of the blue, I had to think about Indonesia's plan to move their capital. It's the first governments planned human relocation in the modern ages. A plan to build a new sustainable capital from scratch and of that size? Amazing stuff. Thinking about the logistics involved to relocate everything is mindblowing. Super fascinating modern large scale enterprise.

Then again, I feel horrified if my mind wonders back to why they had to do this. Severe rainfall, floods and the rising
sea levels seem to forced the city of 10 milion people to move. Climate change.. Maybe I am overthinking this, but have we all (including me) still not mature our thinking? The planet is lashing it's waves, hurling it's winds and is searing us in drought and heat. The weather seems to be different then 10y ago and the difference is even starker compared to 20y ago. Yet, we seem to busy to be worried about not no one, but our own path infront of us. The time is nearing where we will be to late to step up the game. There is still a chance for a future for us and those who come after us. The baby boys and girls born carefree into this world are being saddled with the sins and burdens of our ecological footprints.

Which country is going to be next? One day
