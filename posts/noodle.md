The weather is getting colder and the nights seem emptier than before. Considering these times it is hard not to wonder about how some people in our country are holding out. You see, it's getting harder for people to keep up with their bills. In the meanwhile companies like Shell are reporting record quartarly profits. I found it strange when I heared that they are investing immensely enormously in green energy. It seems like a logical transition in order to be sustainable in the future.

To the scared, silent kid, the one that was terrified with authority, the one that always had to listen or else be punished: Do not fear the walls you have build and deem too high and too complex to wreck down. There is a voice inside of you, who wants to be heard. The strength and courage needed to fight for happiness and freedom does not come from giving up. The deafening silence of loss or pain might dictate the melodies inside the mind, but unchaining the voice within will start the interlude to the sounds of ecstasy and liberty

Words barely seem to flow in an automatic state these days. Every letter or word is automatically being reviewed a dozen of times before it can be left alone. There is a certain feeling to a fluid flowstate, wherein every word just starts popping out of your mind. There are days where words would just get out and every idea thought of make sense in one go, but days of feeling uninspired still triumphs. Is there something I'm missing?

The invisible pittfall of the unchained mind. Dashing and swirling to everything that just manages to grasp its attention for even a milisecond. Everything is fascinating for the unchained mind and therein lies the pitfall of dashing on the single spot of attention.

The source of energy for the creative generalists:
#1 Problemsolving mindset - I feel like this is one of my strong suits. Every day I face a problems with a very high urgency, which requires me to consider a lot of factors and to decide on things in short time. My mind considers it as a puzzle that needs certain parts to be moved in a certain way so things keep moving in the most efficient way I can think of in the shortest amount of time. This does thrill me in ways.  
#2 A faculty for knowledge and variety - An old, dusty library is still remaining in my mind. I have books about everything and anything (not a lot of books, but definitely divers). Variation does keep my mind fresh and it triggers my passion.  
#3 Growth mindset - The old rusty jail that keeps me in check does not allow appreciation in my own abilities. At times the holes in the jail is big enough for me to peek outside and try to escape, but cutting myself at my first attempt to escape does feel like I cannot get out of my own mental detention. Failures are steps in the process of growth.
#4 Building bridges between ideas and people - Love this. Love being able to connect different kind of ideas. Love being able to connect. I never see the evil in people, but my mouth might say harsh things that pains them. I never intend to be ill-fated, but to be of help. (need to figure this out a bit more)
#5 Self determined succes - Success lies in the heart and the memories of my own. Success should always be of personal nature and unrelated to whatever anyone else might think.

Deep inside the brash spirit still survives, who's unable to gauge risks and jumps unconcerning into every situation. Is it a power?
