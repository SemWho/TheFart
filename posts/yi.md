<!-- song: -->

Between a rock and a hard place/a brick wall/an emotional sinkhole/the ineludible fate/the sheer suffocating force of nature
/whatever is written in those stars. A fog inching closer even in times where it seems better. How to be human in inhumane times?
People keep saying that everyone has these phases and it is as if God is trying to shape you into a diamond, but this
heart of mine might not be able to handle it one day. What will happen then? As of now it seems that my bucket is large enough to catch the
pouring of water, but from time to time I still need to break myself so I can keep the drops from escaping. At the end of the day I do have
my moments of sheer loneliness and a heart cannot stop crying out for better times. Even so, let us keep moving.

Step by step, gradually and unflinching movements forward. Have a bad moment? Time to move. Have a good moment? Time to move! Have no time?
Time to move!! Debts, bills and moments of random thought experiments about suicide? Try to move, but take a deep breath first. It does seem damn hard to live a meaningful life when new waves of uncertainty fuel the downspirals existing in the mind. Maybe this diamond is not meant to form
in this lifetime. Maybe the atoms within this body is destined to be of a cycle that could take millions of years before it is part of a diamond.
Somehow with that thought a shimmer of hope lightens up in me.

One day a particle of me might be discovering the universe.
