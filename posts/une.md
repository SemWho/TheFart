4AM, flight in two hours, the winter air is softly brushing against the windows, the terminal is still dimly lit and the only gate with people is the same gate I am waiting at. Time seems to be moving fast and slow at the same time and the

Life did take some strange turns the past couple of years. In the past I did dream of a life wherein I traveled to cities for just a couple of days or a weekend, but I never expected my state to be like this. I do seem healthy, fit and a happy person to a passing eye, but I do feel broken deep inside. Whoever designed this period of time is a cruel person, a person who might just be as bitter as the person I feel like I am becoming. At the same time I just hear a voice inside me saying: 'keep your head up!', well, you ass, you sure are disconnected to whatever hormones the brain is producing at the moment. I just want a happy life. One I can share with the one I love and have cherised for such a long, seperated while. Although it has been a few long years of trying, failing, trying to keep going, hitting my head, fighting the waves of depression, making the best out of it, keeping others positive and now.. now still in the seemingly never ending cycle. I have to continue to live with this mask, a happy mask.

In a few hours I will be flying to see my loved one after not seeing her in 3 months. It has not been long since, but a life together has been gone for far too long, and the sorrow in the heart seems heavier with each passing day and it cuts deeper each time I hit my head. I have to say that my head is a pretty big target; it is not unnatural for me to hit it so often, but each isolated moment with the mind itself, is a moment wherein the mind just fills itself with hope, an empty promise of better times ahead. I do realize this sounds depressed, but how can anybody call this a succes if things seem to crumble? The world economy is in a bad shape and my goals in life stand or fall with the currently downspiraling business I am running.

There is only one truth in life for me, a life full of positive relationships. Yet I am rushing to my love to catch her before she falls, to mend a gaping wound with a bandaid. Is it really worth crossing the deepest valleys to be able to appreciate the mountains in life? Surely there is a limit to how much a person can handle, to how much a person can keep loving.

Winter air brushing against a bleak-coloured heart.
