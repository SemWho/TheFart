My sis KY is a bit weird. She works differently in her head, as each person has it's quirks, but KY is special to me. My older sister has always been in my youthful memories, as a big sister she always protected me. She was a kind, playful, buoyant little kid, but she was always pressured to take care or watch me, because that was her role in the family, eventhough being a kid is all she wanted. Often she took the blame or I sometimes even pushed the blame on her and she never blinked twice to deny it.

In her teenage years, though she was very rebellious and wanted freedom, she never forgot to keep an eye on me and at that time a new responsibility came to her life with a newly born younger sister YY. She was always torn apart in trying to gain freedom and at the same time making sure I did not do stupid shit and cleaning YY after her babyshits.

The schoolingsystem never diagnosed her attention deficit disorder and just stamped a label of "dumb" on her. She was treated as someone who was just unable to learn and she had to fight through school, her mental, the responsibilities at home and just the feeling of being a kid learning in this big world. KY attempted 4 different education and failed to finish one of them, she never had the time anymore because I had to study abroad, so she got trapped at

Somewhere along the road it went wrong for her and she is still in the drag of bad mishappens, undeniably due to people misunderstanding her, or even misusing her and giving her the wrong tools to use in life. The lowest point in my memory with my sis was she was screaming and shouting that she does not care about life anymore, a bit drunk, but somewhere it felt like it was a sincere statement. She almost kicked out a glass door during that emotional outpour and I had to physically hold her down to make her calm down. It feels weird that I had to half choke so she had some time to recollect herself again.

In my lowest point, she is always there How could I ever let that happen? She has always been there for me and never cared about the consequences that it lead to.

I have been penniless and frankly depressed for a while now. My sis decided to
Was I the root of all her problems?
