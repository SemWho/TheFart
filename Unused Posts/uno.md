What if... in the ancient times people were advanced in ways we have forgotten? How deep did their knowledge of astronomy go? There are so many remaining ancient sites that prove that they understood things that we still do not understand. What if there was a world cataclysmic event that wiped the whole world and spared only a few. The few remaining people who set out to repopulate the earth again, trying to rebuild their old, devasted world. 

The Tunguska event in 1908 was caused by an airburst of an meteor of about 50m-60m entering earth's orbit at 27km/s, but is believed to have disintegrated before hitting the ground. And yet, it flattened a surface-area of 2150mÂ² and destroyed 80million trees. What would happen to the world if a storm of meteors enters at high speeds? Nothing would remain.
