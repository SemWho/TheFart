Accoring Randall Carlson, during the Younger Dryass a cosmetic event happened that reshaped the world geography and it's flora&fauna. The Younger Dryass is a short stint about 12000y ago wherein the temperature was swinging drastically from an Ice Age to global warming. Coincedently the Younger Dryass is also known for the extinction of many animal species, which were thought to be hunted to extinction by humankind. Randall Carlsson is right in saying that it does seem ludacris that humans were able to hunt animals like the Wooly Mammoth (/Giant Sloth/sabertooth tigers) to extinction, because just imagine what it would require for us to hunt an animal as big as an elephant to extinction without the weapons we possess right now. There should be some kind of reason why the humankind would do so, be it for the food or wool, but how much food/wool do we even require? It would probably take months for a single person to consume a single mammoth. 

Another point is that there was an enormous icesheet covering the North of America, spanning from Canada to over the half of the US, and somehow that icesheet melted in a very short time-span, causing the sealevels to rise to the levels we are familiar with nowadays. 12k y ago the sealevels were way lower and according to a depiction of the world back then, countries like Indonesia were no archipelago, but vast landmasses (comparible to India). Neither was there a sea seperating the UK and NL. It seems to me that there are mysteries hidden in those grounds that are now covered by the sea. 

Randall suspects that the earth was hit by several meteors during the end of the Younger Dryass, which caused huge floods, caused a mass extinction event and melted the ice. 

The idea of huge floods is very intruiging to me, because during a flight over Saudi Arabia, I saw massive veins that looked like dried up rivers that spanned over hundreds of KM. At the time I was thinking that this was an attempt to exectute the Saudi's masterplan to massively terraform their barren deserts, but it felt unrealistic, it would require huge amounts of water to make that possible. I do need to actually research this a bit more before making certain conclusions. 

To me, the theories of people such as Randall and Graham Hancock are amazing sheer due to them reinvigorating old myths/stories that were just deemed as such. They theorize that the history in this world was told through those stories as there were no other way to share/keep those memories at the time.

It would be amazing if their contemplating would lead to a somewhat of a revolution in thinking. In my eyes, science is the art of constant rethinking old fundaments and testing it.
