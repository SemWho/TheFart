//         In all honesty, we have all been there before. A cycle of at first
//         enthousiasm and sharing excitement to a phase of doubt and uncertainty.
//         Everybody has dreams and it might seem like a perfect picture, but
//         slowly the realization of the work required sets in. Gradually the hype
//         will slow down and the effort required to keep going will increase. Most
//         of them will drop out when the results seem further away then they are
//         willing to dream.
//       </p>
//       <p>
//         People tend to think I'm pessimistic, but most of the time I'm trying to
//         figure out certain aspects and naturally pessimistic sides will come
//         out. In the end, for me it is about how we proceed with the feelings and
//         thoughts. Figuring out all the outcomes creates a framework for me to
//         work and to deal with the possible negatives, so my mind is dealing with
//         negatives before it happens. It might be a mistake, but for now I will
//         see it as a power I have. The power of foresight, you might say.
//       </p>
//       <p>
//         With that being said. It is time to get the grind going and to keep the
//         heart and mind flowing. For I have realized I am a purist, but I was raised
//         to be materialistic and to be greedy for money. Although it does not
//         match well with who I am, I will become greedy for money. I will earn
//         that money, because I want to live a life that is pure. One that is
//         dedicated to whatever I love. To do so I will start with following my
//         passions and my goal is to do the following:

//         - Make a blog publishable ready before 2022 ends.
//         - Train myself to not be bound anymore by location for work
//         - Be with the one I love and with those we love
//       </p>
